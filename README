iTunes does a decent enough job at ripping CDs into one's iTunes library, but
who's got an optical drive connected to their Mac these days?  I don't.  I do,
however, have one in my FreeNAS system, so that's what I want to use to rip
CDs.  This script does a decent enough job at that.  It first uses cdda2wav to
rip the CD to a series of .wav files (using the -cddb flag to get disc and
track info).  It then uses lame to convert the .wav files to .mp3s.  The final
result is a directory in /tmp with mp3s, with a folder and filename structure
that matches the metadata from CDDB.  Which is more or less what iTunes would
have done.
